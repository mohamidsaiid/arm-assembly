# ARM ASSEMBLY Projects

while learning arm assembly I wrote some projects to demonstrate my knowledge into a working programs.


#### 1 - [Reverse String](reverse_string.s)
  reverses the input string in memory in-place in assembly.

#### 2 - [RLE compression algorithm](rle.s)
  An implementation of Run-Length Encoding compression algorithm in assembly.

  
You can run these projects on cpulator website as arm emulator.
